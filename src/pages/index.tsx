        <h2>The Puzzle</h2>
        Step into the world of Star Trek as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in command of the USS
        Enterprise. Help your crew decipher a mysterious distress signal that will eventually lead
        you to a real-world geocache.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Disclaimer:</b> While the puzzle does have a geocache at the end, it can still be enjoyed
        by non-geocachers.

        <h2>About the site</h2>
        The design of this site is based on the LCARS interface used on Federation starships in Star
        Trek: The Next Generation. If you want to solve the puzzle, I recommend doing that before
        looking at the code. I wasn't careful about hiding the solutions from developers.
